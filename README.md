<!-- REPLACE TASKS -->
<h2>Overview</h2>
Your challenge is to build out this GitHub user search app using the GitHub users API and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:
- [ ] View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- [ ] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [x] Search for GitHub users by their username
- [x] See relevant user information based on their search
- [x] Switch between light and dark themes
- [ ] Bonus: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. Hint: Research prefers-color-scheme in CSS.
