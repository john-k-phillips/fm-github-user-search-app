<!-- REPLACE TASKS -->
<h2>Overview</h2>
Your challenge is to build out this GitHub user search app using the GitHub users API and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:
- [ ] View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- [ ] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [x] Search for GitHub users by their username
- [x] See relevant user information based on their search
- [x] Switch between light and dark themes
- [ ] Bonus: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. Hint: Research prefers-color-scheme in CSS.

<h3>What I Learnt</h3>
  <p>
    This was a big learning curve for me, I decided to dive back into using React and TailwindCSS.
    I already knew the basics of React; however, practicing after such a long time was challenging and well worth the time spent on this project.
  </p>
<h3>Continued Development</h3>
  <p>
    The intention of this project was the code; which, I'm happy and accomplished it my goal. Despite this, the TailwindCSS (design aspect) suffered slightly.
  I hope to come back to this project and redo the design; potentially with CSS to have full control over each element.
